## Let's create our own package manager

* Create a node program
* Check for the first process argument to be init
* If the first argument is init continue processing else end the program
* check if a file named package.json already exists, if it does exit the program
* Use readline to ask for 5 inputs
* Create a string that is a json object
* The key values should be the inputs you get from the user
* Save this json to a file called package.json

# Bonus
* Don't hardcode 5 readlines
* Don't using string concatenation or template literals
